This software was written for an ethanol suggar cane power plant.
It helps manage its fleet/drivers and crops.
One of many functions is to :
    - Register fleet(trucks/tractors, etc)
    - Register Workers/Drivers
    - Weight Truck Loads
    - Fuel Comsumption
    - Generate reports
    and others.

As this software was written nearly 10 years ago, you may find it a little hard to compile and make use of the software.
Feel free to use and fork the repository if you wish to bring this back to life.

Regards,

Andy.
